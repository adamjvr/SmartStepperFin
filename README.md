SmartStepperFin
===============

An intelligent stepper fin for TinyG. This stepper fin features a ARM Cortex M0+ to incorporate closed loop control of the stepper, also stepper curretn ref voltage will be PWM not potentiometer (more accurate control of driver current).

Specs:
- Ti DRV8825 Stepper Driver
- ML0516VLF4 ARM Cortex M0+ 48MHZ QFN 24
- Quandrature Encoder Port
- Expansion header for dev/hacking
